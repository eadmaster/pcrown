Btw since this was originally [released with a GPL-2.0 license](https://github.com/eadmaster/pcrown/blob/master/LICENSE), i'd like to exercise my right to keep working on this and make improvements.


## Current status

 - All story events, items and names translated
   - using a fixed-width/monospaced font, with condensed spaces (not VWF)
 - All doorway signs are translated: https://github.com/eadmaster/pcrown/issues/102
 - All book/scenarios fully tested and crash-free
   - 2 cutscenes have reduced dialogues to bypass softlocks: https://github.com/eadmaster/pcrown/issues/30  https://github.com/eadmaster/pcrown/issues/88
