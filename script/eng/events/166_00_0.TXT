<CC03EA><color=0006><string=0011><lineend><color=0001>My little sister is the one who sells the milk.<pause><lineend><CC03EA>I saw her heading out of the village a minute ago. I wonder if she's all right?<pause><lineend><CC03EA>She was going toward the <color=0002>Forest of Bewilderment,<color=0001> but I can't imagine she'd have gone inside...<pause><lineend>|

<CC03EA><color=0006><string=0011><lineend><color=0001>Would you care to buy some Fresh Milk?<pause><lineend>|

<CC03EA><color=0006><string=000A><lineend><color=0001>I've heard that Witch Canes are surprisingly useful.<pause><lineend><CC03EA>Apparently, you can use them to change weaker monsters into little animals.<pause><lineend>|

<CC03EA><color=0006><string=001C><lineend><color=0001>Oh look! A little witch!<pause><lineend>|

<CC03EA><color=0006><string=001C><lineend><color=0001>One big problem is that the goats love the grass that grows in the Forest of Bewilderment.<pause><lineend><CC03EA>We have to be extra careful to keep them away from there.<pause><lineend>|

<CC03EA><color=0006><string=001C><lineend><color=0001>Best of luck in your travels, dearie!<pause><lineend>|

<CC03EA><color=0006><string=0028><lineend><color=0005>The forest outside the village<color=0001> is called the <color=0002>Forest of Bewilderment.<color=0001><pause><lineend><CC03EA>There's a monster deep within it that uses illusions to make people lose their way.<pause><lineend><CC03EA>Once I went into it by accident, and I barely made it back out.<pause><lineend><CC03EA>Of course, the Unicorn's forest to the east is completely different.<pause><lineend>|
10|
<CC03EA><color=0006><string=0028><lineend><color=0001>If the monster is gone, maybe we can start going into that forest?<pause><lineend><CC03EA>There's nothing "bewildering" about it anymore, after all.<pause><lineend>|

16|
<CC03EA><color=0006><string=0027><lineend><color=0001>No no!<pause><lineend><CC03EA>It's because my little sister took the goats out on a walk and hasn't come back.<pause><lineend><CC03EA>She should be back any minute now...<pause><lineend><CC03EA>Listen, just stick around, and I'll sell you you some cheap the moment they get back.<pause><lineend>|
